# Quickstart: Pokedex List and Details

## Purpose

Verify the Pokedex list, favorites, and detail screens match the specification
and the `style_reference.png` visual direction.

## Preconditions

- App builds and launches successfully.
- Network connectivity available for PokeAPI access.

## Happy Path

1. Launch the app; confirm the first screen is a Pokedex list.
2. Scroll the list; confirm items show name and image, with stable layout.
3. Tap a Pokemon; confirm the detail screen shows name, image, stats,
   description, abilities, and other key attributes.
4. Navigate back; confirm the list restores the previous scroll position.
5. Toggle favorite on a list item; relaunch and confirm favorite persists.

## Visual Verification

- Compare list and detail screens against `style_reference.png` for colors,
  content hierarchy, typography, and spacing.
